//TODO: command buffer provider for compute functions? do i need to differentiate this?
//TODO: buffer providers for input to render/compute functions
// - reusing a pool of these buffers should greatly increase performance
// - but locks us down to a particular size of buffer ... or does it??
// - if you just instantiate the largest buffer you'll need, then no.
// - however, it does make it more difficult to specialize the behavior you need 
//   for the buffer's memory (StorageModeShared, posix_memalign, etc.)
// - and thus, it makes it more difficult to develop rendering behavior, as your
//   nodes need to be aware of the implementation you're using
